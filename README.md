# CounterJS

The main of the coutner is to practice different key concepts such as

1.**document.querySelectorAll()**
2.**document.getElementById()**
3.**forEach()**
4.**addEventListener()**
5.**currentTarget property**
6.**classList**
7.**textContent**

My vision is to get godd bacics in order to continue improving to get better at coding.
